## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

# Project Setup

## Database Seeding with Images

The project includes a database seeder that automatically handles question data and associated images. To properly set up and run the seeder:

1. Ensure all question images are placed in the `database/seeders/images/` directory
2. Run the database migrations:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```
3. Run the database seeder:
   ```bash
   php artisan db:seed
   ```

The seeder will automatically:
- Copy all required images from `database/seeders/images/` to the public assets directory
- Create question records in the database
- Handle any missing images gracefully with proper logging

### Image Requirements
- All images should be placed in `database/seeders/images/` directory
- Supported image names are defined in the QuestionSeeder
- Images will be automatically copied to `public/asset/` when seeding
